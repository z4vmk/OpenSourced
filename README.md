# Open Sourced ~ by z4vmk
This is a collection of utlities and stuff I create, mainly used to store stuff I wanna use later.
These are free to use anywhere and how you want, credit is only requested if publishing online.

It includes the source code of them, along with examples if required.

## Web Open Sourced
Some web development assets or entire sites that I've made.

[__**Portfolio**__](https://github.com/z4vmk/portfolio) |
My current work-in-progress portfolio, created to mimic Visual Studio Code. It's made in Nuxt.

[__**React Toggle Theme**__](https://github.com/z4vmk/react-toggle-theme) |
A simple component to switch between dark and light themes, originally by [forgng](https://github.com/forgng).

## Discord Open Sourced
Majority of my Discord projects use Sapphire, a Discord Bot framework.

[__**ButtonPrompts**__](https://github.com/z4vmk/OpenSourced/tree/main/Discord/ButtonPrompt) |
Created to simplify the process of creating button component collectors. It's not really a "prompt system", but I suppose it's just up to whatever you believe it is.

[__**SapphireClient**__](https://github.com/z4vmk/OpenSourced/tree/main/Discord/SapphireClient) |
A tweaked version of the SapphireClient to meet my needs. It's really just a template to get started on a new project faster.
